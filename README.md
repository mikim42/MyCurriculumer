# MyCurriculumer

## Motivation
There are systems such as MyProgress and MyPlanner for curriculum paths but not useful as it intended(or at least it should) on developing roadmaps or guidelines. I find it is because their non-flexible functionalities and not enough suggestions/guidelines. Which leads students to see advisors every semester just to confirm what classes to take, and because of that, advisor appointments are always full. That makes it difficult to see advisors when needed.
It has dragged a lot of frustration among students, so to reduce those of unnecessarily wasted time and effort, we are working on this project MyCurriculumer.

## Purpose
To help SJSU students plan their curriculum paths
1. Provide various pre-built roadmaps for different goals(specific field focused)
2. Manage and cumstomize roadmaps for individual
3. Reduce the number of advisor appointments to remove academic holds

## Program
MyCurriculumer will help students plan their roadmaps. Pre-made general roadmaps can give students a hint of popular classes and specific field focused roadmaps can provide roadmaps with courses related to their goals.
GUI will give easy interations and understanding of prerequisites.
One application will help students check their graduation requirements, how much they have fulfilled, and future plans. So, students won't need to jump around between applications to check those information.
